# BN-Sports-DB

This was my final project for my web development class. The goal was to create a website with HTML/CSS, MySQL, and PHP. 
For this project, I also decided to also use JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON on my own.

What this website does is allows users to register, login, and then search for their favorite professional athletes.
